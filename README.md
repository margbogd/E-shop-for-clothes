# E-shop-for-clothes

## Hybrid mobile app (Cordova CLI or Phonegap build)

### Topic: 
#### Frontend for e-shop for clothes - *No Backend/Server needed*

* Requirements/user needs:
  * As a user I want to login on my e-shop account
  * As a user I want to see a list of specific cloth-types (with filters e.g. show me only men's t-shirts)
  * As a user I want to have the ability to view the details of a specific cloth (basic info only like image, description, title)
  * As a user I want to have the ability to add the clothes I want to buy on my basket (no extra functionality needed)
 
* Technologies: 
  * AngularJs 1.X & Ionic UI Framework
  * Use Angular material JS library for the HTML5 componets you are going to use (e.g. list, button, dialog, ...)
  
* Notes:
  * Use mock data (store the necessary data you will need locally e.g. user accounts, cloth lists ..)
  * Feel free to use any other library/framework
