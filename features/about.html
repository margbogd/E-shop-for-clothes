        </br>
        <p>Our story began back in 1996 with a treble clef that became the hallmark of our firm. We celebrate our unique sense of style by inviting young women and men from around the world to discover all the melodies, energy and emotions behind Stradivarius - the fashion brand that moves to the sound of its own unique melody.</p>
        </br>
        <p>We design thousands of clothing items and accessories in France for exclusive distribution to our stores, which can be found in over 50 countries around the world, as well as to our online store, which started operating in 2012.</p>
        </br>
        <p>We are fully aware that what makes our customers happy today may not be what they want tomorrow, which is why we are constantly hunting down the latest trends to come up with the perfect looks for every occasion.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Each day, more than 10,000 employees with an authentic passion for fashion keep the Stradivarius facilities buzzing with activity, turning it into an authentic fashion hotspot. We take our passion with us wherever we go, enabling us to attract the world's most talented fashion professionals.</p>
